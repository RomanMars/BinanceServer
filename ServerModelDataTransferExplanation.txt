ServerModelDataTransferExplanation

web socket on get data event:

binanceserver::ASKSv binanceserver::BIDSv -> Whole data (bids, asks) data
binanceserver::asksv binanceserver::bidsv -> Data geted on current update

store asksv, bidsv and current update data -> in data buffer

send buffer via sockets
or store in memmory
examples: shared memory, memory maps, boost interprocess or similar libs

i think shared memory is best solution -> because it's fast and effective
